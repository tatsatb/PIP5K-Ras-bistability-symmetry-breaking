For the level-set simulation:


1. Ensure the corresponding kymograph data file from reaction-diffusion simulations is located in the “Kymograph_Data” folder.
2. Set the appropriate file_type, and adjust idx1 and idx2 (note: idx/10 corresponds to time in seconds).
3. Run run_level_set_main.m.
4. The output will be saved in the LSM_output folder.
5. To visualize the level set, run LSM_view.m.
